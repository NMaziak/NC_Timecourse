# ImpulseDE2 Analaysis
While DESeq2 is a powerful way to analyze both pairwise and timecourse experiments, we wanted to explore the possibility of using alternative methods to analyze our data. ImpulseDE2 uses a negative binomial model as the backbone of it's differential testing for count-based data. It uses an impulse model to create a smoothed expression trajectory for each gene, and tests these trajectories to identify enriched genes.
